// This a shortcut to help you visually see your layout.
// There are a number of variations depending on the layout of your bottom row.
// The arrow variant adds an additional key on the bottom-right, while the
// command variant adds an additional key on the bottom-left. arrow-command is a
// combination of both of those, having an additional key on both sides.
//
// Please note that the numbering of the macro arguments are based on the
// numbers of the keys on the PCB.
